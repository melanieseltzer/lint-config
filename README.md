# Lint Config

> Common Eslint and Prettier config for my projects âœ¨

A setup for Eslint and Prettier that I've come to use quite frequently. This is just to organize everything in one place, so I can get started quickly in the future. Also has my setup for Husky and lint-staged.

For JavaScript, I extend the [Airbnb style guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/). For TypeScript, I'm still using Eslint via [typescript-eslint](https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint) and setup using [this guide](https://www.thedreaming.org/2019/03/27/eslint-with-typescript/).

My code style can be summed up as:

- Indent lines with spaces, not tabs
- Use single quotes, not double
- Spaces between brackets in object literals
- Semi-colons at the end of statements
- No trailing commas
- Don't include parenthesis around a sole arrow function parameter

## Getting Started

Clone the repo (or alternatively, just download a zip from Github):

```
git clone git@github.com:melanieseltzer/lint-config.git
```

Choose your flavor (JavaScript or TypeScript), and follow the instructions in the individual readmes.
