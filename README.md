# Eslint and Prettier config

> Common Eslint and Prettier config for my projects âœ¨

A setup for Eslint and Prettier that I've come to use quite frequently. This is just to organize everything in one place, so I can get started quickly in the future. Also has my setup for Husky and lint-staged.

## Usage

Clone the repo:

```
git clone git@github.com:melanieseltzer/lint-config.git
```

Or alternatively, just download a zip from Github.

Then copy the `package.json` and dotfiles into the new project, and install dependencies:

```
yarn install
```

And you're good to go!
